1.function/script (1)  Written mrtrix shell script to conduct ROI to ROI ensemble tracking
   pestillilab_projects/life_conn/mrtrix_btw_rois.sh
	this script takes an input of path to fit mrtrix files ready for tracking and a folder of .mif ROI files to track b/w each unique pair
	this script then writes all the .tck files to a single folder with 1) sequential number for aligning fibers to roi/algorithm and 
	2) the type/curve/roi1/roi2 labels associated with the files

2.function/script (2)  Load and save the .tck files into .mat files
   While this happend, the counts of fibers per .tck file are stored so they can be used in feVirtualLesion
   Plan: build a tensor model of fiber outputs: roi x roi x tractography type x fiber count;
   	 tractography type adds a dimension for each variable iterated across (det/prob, curvature, lmax, etc.) - multiple dictionaries
	 one dictionary will be a fiber count
	 dictionary always contains strings - ROI names, tractography types, (det/prob, curvature, etc.)
	 This will allow for simplified indexing of whole brain connectivity for every combination of tractography variables and combining them.
   Output:   
   	2.1) .mat file for each fiber group
   	2.2) series of dictionaries and a multi-dimensional array tensor  
   	2.3) merged .mat fiber group where fiber order can be indexed from 2.2 output

3. function/script (3) Build LiFE model and optimize using the merged FG from (2), svae to disk
4. function/script (4) load FE from (3) perfomr virtual lesions, save to disk results into a matrix
5. compute BCT stats on marix from 4. IMPORTANTLY: We will need code that can take any subset of ET fascicles using the Tensor and dictionaries
    and rcompute 4. and 5. by leasioning only those fascicles.

* Cesar and Franco?
6. Change the virtual lesion code to exploit the multi-diminsional arrays existing in the new life model (Phi).
   Instead of End -> Fiber -> voxels, index fibers in tensor - many fewer look-up steps
